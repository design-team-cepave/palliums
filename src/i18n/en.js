      q: 'What is Pallet?',
      ans: 'The core action of the Pallet Technology consist of the following three parts. First, build up such basic token, like Palli, for general usage. Second, strategically enable infrastructure-level services that can be used in many applications. The analogy of the first step and the second step is like Android and GMS (Google Mobile Services), Third, finally empower governance bodies and people communities to create their own Pallium social contracts on the platforms and blockchains they so choose. All the world computers above can be interacted through the open-source Pallium technology. Thus, today’s global internet can generally grow into a world of internet and interchain.'

      q: 'How does the Pallet Token distribution work?',
      ans: 'Initial Palli will be produced in the ICO. We also can get corresponding Palli in return by investing Bitcoin or Ether in the Palli contract.It’s only allowed to acquire Palli by joining the ICO, being a notary to collect transaction fee and buying it.(+增發)Palli is valuable, because Palli can be used to “buy” the computing power of Notary for transaction verification. Palli Glu is priced by the price of computation power (e.g., PC or cloud service). Competition among Notaries may result in discount and make Palli more valuable. In addition, Palli can be used as the medium of value transferring like Settlement currency.'
