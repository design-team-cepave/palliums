      q: 'What is PALLET?',
      ans: 'The core action of the PALLET Technology consist of the following three parts. First, build up such basic token, like PAL, for general usage. Second, strategically enable infrastructure-level services that can be used in many applications. The analogy of the first step and the second step is like Android and GMS (Google Mobile Services), Third, finally empower governance bodies and people communities to create their own PALLET social contracts on the platforms and blockchains they so choose. All the world computers above can be interacted through the open-source PALLET technology. Thus, today’s global internet can generally grow into a world of internet and interchain.'

      q: 'What features do PALLET have?',
      ans: 'PALLET’s first step shall bring you a decentralized/distributed contract execution environment that supports secure and private contract execution on multiple blockchains to achieve on-chain, inter-chain, and even off-chain consideration exchange, and an inclusive environment that supports multiple programming languages and multiple execution platforms to allow the contracts to be triggered anytime and anywhere.'
    }, {
      q: 'How does the PALLET Token distribution work?',
      ans: 'Initial PAL will be produced in the ICO. We also can get corresponding PAL in return by investing Bitcoin or Ether in the PAL contract.It’s only allowed to acquire PAL by joining the ICO, being a notary to collect transaction fee and buying it.(+增發)PAL is valuable, because PAL can be used to “buy” the computing power of Notary for transaction verification. PAL Glu is priced by the price of computation power (e.g., PC or cloud service). Competition among Notaries may result in discount and make PAL more valuable. In addition, PAL can be used as the medium of value transferring like Settlement currency.'
